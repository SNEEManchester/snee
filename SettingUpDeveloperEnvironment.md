# Tools Installation #

  * Install a Java development kit <br> (We recommend using the most recent version of Java 1.6. The code is known not to work with versions of Java prior to 1.6.0_4 due to the dependency on CXF and JAXB.)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Install a Subversion Client<br>
<ul><li><a href='http://subversion.tigris.org/'>http://subversion.tigris.org/</a> <br> (Version 1.6.x is required)</li></ul></li></ul>

  * Install Maven
    * http://maven.apache.org/ <br> (Version 2.2.1 or higher is required)<br>
<ul><li>Using a Linux package manager: apt-get install maven2</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>Install Eclipse<br>
<ul><li><a href='http://www.eclipse.org/downloads'>http://www.eclipse.org/downloads</a> <br> (Galileo or preferably Helios is required)</li></ul></li></ul>

  * Install Eclipse Plugins
    * Subclipse (for SVN support)
      * http://subclipse.tigris.org/
      * The Eclipse update site is http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x
    * m2eclipse (for Maven support, including the extras)
      * http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html
      * The Eclipse update sites are http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e and http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e-extras.

Note, for linux you need to install libsvn-java.  Using a package manager, this involves invoking:
  * apt-get install libsvn-java

# Obtain and Build the Source Code #

  * Configure Maven
    * Edit the settings.xml (possibly in ~/.m2 or /etc/maven2) and add two servers with the id ssg4e.internal and ssg4e.snapshot
```
<server>
	<id>serverid</id>
	<username>your-techideas-username</username>
	<pasword>your-techideas-password</password>
</server>
```
    * A [sample settings.xml](http://snee.googlecode.com/files/settings.xml) file is available from the Downloads section of this site.
    * Note: Eventually we will get rid of this dependency.

  * Create a new eclipse workspace (we recommend a new workspace since the project contains several modules)
  * Using the SVN Repository Perspective in Eclipse (accessed via Window->Open Perspective->Other), add the Google SVN URL to your list of SVN repositories:
    * https://snee.googlecode.com/svn/
    * This is accessed using your google username and a password which is generated by going into your personal google code settings (i.e., not your regular google password).
  * Open the folder and Right-click on the trunk folder, and select ‘Check out as Maven Project’.  Click on Finish.
    * Maven will automatically download all the depencies of the project and conduct an initial build
    * Switch to the Java Perspective
      * A parent project called 'SNEE' has been created in the workspace.
        * Modules of SNEE, such as the clients and compiler, will appear as separate projects
  * Right click on the compiler module project, go to the maven context menu, select ‘update project configuration’.
    * This configures the build path to use the generated antlr parser

**Note:** the code will not compile from within eclipse if you check out the code using some external method and use the import maven project option.


## Building the Project Using Eclipse ##

  * Within the Eclipse package explorer, right-click on the SNEE project and select 'Run As' -> 'Maven package'
  * Tip: If you update from the SVN, and experience problems building the project, try right-clicking on the SNEE project and selecting 'Run As' -> 'Maven clean'

## Building the Project From the Command Line ##

The Maven Eclipse plugin doesn't always work perfectly.  If you are still having problems, from the terminal go to the root directory of the SNEE parent project and invoke:
  * mvn clean
  * mvn install
  * mvn package
Then in eclipse refresh the files in the package explorer (select all of them, right-click-Refresh).
Then, again on all the selected packages do:
  * Right click - Maven - Update Dependencies
  * Right click - Maven - Update Snapshorts
  * Right click - Maven - Update Project Config
(in that order)

and all errors should disappear.
